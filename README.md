## Description

Insecure Content Warning helps content creators with secure (HTTPS) websites avoid insecure-content warnings in the browser by flagging any elements in the editor (such as images and embeds) that are being delivered or sourced from an insecure (HTTP) web address. All insecure elements are flagged before the content is published, and can be fixed manually or simply by clicking "fix it."

Compatible with both the block and classic editors.
